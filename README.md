FateBoard
=========

A Fate Board helper. Yeah, I know, it doesn't say a thing, but It still in an early phase.

It uses NodeJS, Express and MongoDB. You can see a good validation system (I think it's good, but you know...). Check it if you want :)

Ah! I am working in a API that eventually will be in this app. You can check it in http://docs.fateboard.apiary.io/
